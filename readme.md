# solvent

A calculator using [math.js](https://mathjs.org) with a couple of features. More to be added later (or eventually!). Written entirely in vanilla JavaScript.

### Features

* Solve equations
* Simplify them
* Convert fractions to decimal
* Round numbers

More will be added soon. If you want to help out (and please do!) then submit a pull request.

Pull requests for anything, from minor code prettification, bug fixes, even whole new functions are very appreciated.
